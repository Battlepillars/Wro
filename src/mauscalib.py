#
# This example demonstrates how to calibrate the SparkFun Qwiic Optical
# Tracking Odometry Sensor (OTOS).

# This example should be used to calibrate the linear and angular scalars of
# the OTOS to get the most accurate tracking performance. The linear scalar
# can be used to compensate for scaling issues with the x and y measurements,
# while the angular scalar can be used to compensate for scaling issues with
# the heading measurement. Note that if the heading measurement is off, that
# can also cause the x and y measurements to be off, so it's recommended to
# calibrate the angular scalar first.

    # when it powers up, but it is recommended to perform a more thorough
    # calibration at the start of all your programs. Note that the sensor must
    # be completely stationary and flat during calibration! When calling
    # calibrateImu(), you can specify the number of samples to take and whether
    # to wait until the calibration is complete. If no parameters are provided,
    # it will take 255 samples and wait until done; each sample takes about
    # 2.4ms, so about 612ms total

    myOtos2.calibrateImu(255)

    # Alternatively, you can specify the number of samples and whether to wait

    # how many samples remain with the code below. Once zero samples remain,
    # the calibration is done!

    # Here we can set the linear and angular scalars, which can compensate for
    # scaling issues with the sensor measurements. Note that as of firmware
    # version 1.0, these values will be lost after a power cycle, so you will
    # need to set them each time you power up the sensor. They can be any value
    # from 0.872 to 1.127 in increments of 0.001 (0.1%). It is recommended to
    # first set both scalars to 1.0, then calibrate the angular scalar, then
    # the linear scalar. To calibrate the angular scalar, spin the robot by
    # multiple rotations (eg. 10) to get a precise error, then set the scalar
    # to the inverse of the error. Remember that the angle wraps from -180 to
    # 180 degrees, so for example, if after 10 rotations counterclockwise
    # (positive rotation), the sensor reports -15 degrees, the required scalar
    # would be 3600/3585 = 1.004. To calibrate the linear scalar, move the
    # robot a known distance and measure the error; do this multiple times at
    # multiple speeds to get an average, then set the linear scalar to the
    # inverse of the error. For example, if you move the robot 100 inches and
    # the sensor reports 103 inches, set the linear scalar to 100/103 = 0.971
